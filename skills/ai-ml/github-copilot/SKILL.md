# GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is the enterprise standard. 2025 features **Copilot Workspace** (Idea-to-PR workflow) and **Copilot Edits** (multi-file awareness).

## When to Use

- **Enterprise**: SOC2 compliant, IP indemnity.
- **In-IDE**: Works in VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Vim.
- **CLI**: `gh copilot suggest "how to tar a folder"`.

## Core Concepts

### Copilot Workspace

A dev environment where you describe a task, and Copilot generates a plan + code + tests, then opens a PR.

### Copilot Chat

Chat interface aware of your open files and selection.

### Ghost Text

The gray text completions as you type.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Workspace for Issues**: Start a task from a GitHub Issue -> "Open in Workspace".
- **Comment Driven Dev**: Write a comment `// Calculate fibonacci`, wait for completion.
- **Context**: Keep relevant files open. Copilot looks at open tabs for context.

**Don't**:

- **Don't blindly accept**: Verify security and logic.
