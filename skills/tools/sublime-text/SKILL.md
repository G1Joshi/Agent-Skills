# Sublime Text 4

Sublime Text is legendary for its speed and "Goto Anything" (`Cmd+P`) interface. Even in 2025, it remains the fastest GUI editor for opening massive files.

## When to Use

- **Large Files**: Opening a 500MB SQL dump? VS Code chokes. Sublime opens it instantly.
- **Regex**: Multi-cursor + Regex find/replace workflow is unparalleled.
- **Minimalism**: Distraction-free coding without 50 sidebars.

## Core Concepts

### Package Control

The extension manager. Must be installed first.

### Computed Layout

Mini-map (on the right) allows visual navigation of code shape.

### Projects

`sublime-project` files allow saving workspace state (open tabs, layout).

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use LSP**: The `LSP` package brings VS Code-like intelligence to Sublime.
- **Buy a License**: Support indie developers. It's worth it.
- **Keep it Light**: Don't turn it into an IDE. Use it for its speed.

**Don't**:

- **Don't ignore startup time**: Keep plugins to a minimum.
