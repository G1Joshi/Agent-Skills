# Eclipse IDE

Eclipse was the dominant Java IDE for a decade. While IntelliJ has taken the lead, Eclipse remains critical for **legacy enterprise** projects and specific industries (Embedded, Auto).

## When to Use

- **Legacy Projects**: Projects built with bespoke Eclipse plugins.
- **OSGi / RCP**: Developing Eclipse plugins or Rich Client Platform apps.
- **Free/Open Source**: Fully FOSS philosophy.

## Core Concepts

### Workspace

Collection of Projects.

### Perspectives

Layouts of views (Java Perspective, Debug Perspective).

### plugins

The OSGi plugin system is the core of Eclipse.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Eclipse Theia**: If you want a modern, VS Code-like experience built on Eclipse tech.
- **Keep it Updated**: The quarterly rolling releases improve performance.

**Don't**:

- **Don't use for modern Web Dev**: It lags behind VS Code/WebStorm for JS/TS.
