# Discord

Discord is where developer communities live. 2025 updates to the **Social SDK** allow building rich "Activities" (Embedded Apps) inside Discord.

## When to Use

- **Open Source Communities**: React, Vue, generic dev communities.
- **Real-time Voice/Video**: "Office Hours" channels.
- **Bots**: Automate community management.

## Core Concepts

### Servers / Guilds

The community container.

### Channels

Text, Voice, or Forum channels.

### Webhooks

Simple way to post messages from scripts (CI/CD notifications).

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Forums**: For support questions (keeps tech support threaded and searchable).
- **Build Activities**: Create interactive mini-apps for your community.
- **Use Threads**: Keep conversations organized.

**Don't**:

- **Don't use for confidential work**: It's not end-to-end encrypted like Signal, though Voice security is improving.
