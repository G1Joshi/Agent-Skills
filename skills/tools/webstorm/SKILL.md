# WebStorm

WebStorm is the JetBrains IDE for Web. While VS Code is free, WebStorm allows better refactoring for complex **TypeScript**, **Angular**, and **React** projects.

## When to Use

- **Large Refactors**: Moving files updates imports 100% correctly, even in dynamic imports.
- **Angular**: Has the best Angular template support in the industry.
- **Debugging**: Node.js debugger is seamless.

## Core Concepts

### Local History

A built-in generic version control. You can revert changes even if you haven't committed to Git.

### Live Templates

Expand abbreviations into code snippets. (e.g. `log` -> `console.log`).

### Prettier/ESLint Integration

Runs them automatically on save or analysis.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use "AI Assistant"**: Generate unit tests for your components.
- **Use Database Tools**: Connect to your database directly from WebStorm (it includes DataGrip features).
- **Use Version Control**: The Git UI (Merge Conflict Resolver) is superior to almost any standalone tool.

**Don't**:

- **Don't ignore indexing**: Let it finish before judging performance.
