# Obsidian

Obsidian is a knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of Markdown files. 2025 features **Bases** (Database views) and native **Canvas**.

## When to Use

- **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)**: Zettelkasten method.
- **Privacy**: Your data is just files on your disk. No cloud lock-in.
- **Research**: Linking complex ideas together.

## Core Concepts

### Links

`[[Internal Link]]` connects ideas. The "Graph View" visualizes these connections.

### Plugins

Community plugins transform it into a task manager (`Dataview`, `Tasks`).

### Canvas

Infinite whiteboard for visual brainstorming with cards/notes.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use `Dataview`**: Query your notes like a database.
- **Use Templates**: Standardize "Daily Notes" or "Meeting Notes".
- **Sync**: Use Obsidian Sync or iCloud/Git for mobile access.

**Don't**:

- **Don't hoard plugins**: Start simple. Too many plugins slow it down.
