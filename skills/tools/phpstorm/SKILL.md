# PhpStorm

PhpStorm is essential for modern PHP. It understands **Laravel** Facades, **Symfony** Dependency Injection, and **Doctrine** queries.

## When to Use

- **PHP**: It is practically mandatory for professional PHP dev.
- **Blade / Twig**: Excellent support for template engines.
- **Database**: Integrated SQL tools are fantastic.

## Core Concepts

### Composer Integration

Manages dependencies and `composer.json` synced with the project model.

### Pest / PHPUnit

Visual test runner integration.

### Remote Development (SSH)

Edit files directly on the server (if you must) or use Deployment configurations.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Install Laravel Idea**: A paid plugin but transforms the Laravel experience.
- **Use Xdebug**: PhpStorm makes setting up Step Debugging easier than any other tool.
- **Type Hinting**: Use the IDE to add return types and strict types to modernize legacy code.

**Don't**:

- **Don't disable inspections**: They find bugs (SQL injection risks, undefined variables) instantly.
