# Visual Studio

Visual Studio (not VS Code) is the heavyweight IDE for .NET (C#, F#) and C++ development. VS 2022 (64-bit) manages massive solutions.

## When to Use

- **C# / .NET**: The gold standard.
- **Game Dev**: Unity and Unreal Engine development.
- **Enterprise**: Powerful debugging, profiling, and architecture tools.

## Core Concepts

### Solution (.sln)

Groups multiple Projects (.csproj).

### IntelliCode

AI-assisted code completion (predicts whole lines based on your coding habits).

### Hot Reload

Apply code changes to a running app without restarting (C# / C++).

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use 64-bit**: VS 2022 is x64. It can load solutions with 10,000 projects.
- **Use Live Unit Testing**: Runs tests automatically as you type.
- **Use GitHub Copilot**: Integrated deeply into the IDE.

**Don't**:

- **Don't confuse with VS Code**: They are completely different products.
