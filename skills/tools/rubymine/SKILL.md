# RubyMine

RubyMine provides specialized tooling for **Ruby** and **Rails**. It excels at navigating the "Magic" of Rails (views to controllers, routes to actions).

## When to Use

- **Ruby on Rails**: It connects the dots that text editors miss.
- **RSpec / Cucumber**: Visual test runner and step definition navigation.
- **Debugging**: `ruby-debug-ide` integration is seamless.

## Core Concepts

### Rails Project View

Groups Models, Views, and Controllers logically.

### ERB / Slim / Haml

Full support for template languages.

### Gem Management

GUI for `Gemfile` and `bundle install`.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use "Go to Route"**: Search standard Rails routes and jump to controller actions.
- **Use RuboCop**: Integrated linter.
- **Model Dependency Diagram**: Visualize your ActiveRecord associations (has_many, belongs_to).

**Don't**:

- **Don't guess functionality**: Ctrl+Click method names to see where they are defined (even metaprogrammed ones sometimes).
