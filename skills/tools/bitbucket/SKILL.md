# Bitbucket

Bitbucket is Atlassian's Git solution. Its superpower is **Jira Integration**.

## When to Use

- **Jira Shops**: If you use Jira, Bitbucket links code to tickets automatically.
- **Data Center**: Enterprise self-managed instances.

## Core Concepts

### Sourcetree

Atlassian's free Git GUI Key. Highly popular on Mac/Windows.

### Pipelines

Bitbucket's CI system (YAML based).

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Smart Commits**: "JIRA-123 #close" in commit message closes the Jira ticket.
- **Use Code Insights**: View report data (test coverage) on PRs.

**Don't**:

- **Don't ignore security**: Enable 2FA and SSH keys.
